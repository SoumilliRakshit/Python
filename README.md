# Python
1️⃣ Variables (storing information)

A variable is just a box that stores data.

age = 18
name = "Soumili"
cgpa = 8.5


= means assign

Python figures out the type automatically

2️⃣ Data types (what kind of data?)
age = 18          # integer (int)
cgpa = 8.5        # decimal (float)
name = "Soumili"  # text (string)
is_student = True # boolean

3️⃣ Printing output

To see something, we use print().

print(age)
print(name)


Output:

18
Soumili

4️⃣ Mixing text + variables
print("My name is", name)
print("I am", age, "years old")


Python automatically spaces things for you.

5️⃣ Simple math (very important for econ)
income = 50000
expenses = 32000

savings = income - expenses
print("Savings:", savings)
